Sweep algorithms get stuck when run on many cpus (e.g. -np 8 with mpi1.py and N=20)
GUESS: insertion sort is run on badly ordered sets with O(n ^2) complexity

Running drum.py in parallel exposes a contact detection bug: some boxes are
not tested for intersection and balls are left to interpenetrate the case
