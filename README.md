# Solfec-1.0
Parallel Non-Smooth Contact Dynamics using MPI, C and Python. [See documentaion](http://parmes.github.io/solfec-1.0)

Solfec-1.0 implements the Non-Smooth Contact Dynamics Method [1,2] using MPI, C, Python and several 3rd party
codes written in C/C++/Fortran. It includes mesh, convex polyhedra, sphere and ellipsoid based shapes,
linear elastic first order finite elements, pseudo-rigid and rigid kinematics, velocity based Signorini-Coulomb
contact/impact law, and a parallel time stepping combined with a simple dynamic load balancing. Solfec-1.0
has been developed as a part of research [3], and it continues to be developed and maintained since.
