A prismatic bar with x,y,z dimensions 0.1x0.1x1 m and material parameters E in { 200E4 Pa,200E9 Pa} ,
nu=0.26,\ho=7.8E3 kg /m^3 is rotating about the x-axis with an initial angular velocity of 1 rad/s.
The bar is discretized with 2x2x20 fully integrated trilinear hexahedral elements.  This results
in 576 degrees of freedom fully resolved finite element (FE) models. Four FE formulations are compared:

 * Total Lagrangian (TL)
 * Body co-rotational (BC)
 * Body co-rotation reduced order (BC-RO)
 * Body co-rotation modal (BC-MODAL)

For the reduced order BC-RO approach 100 co-rotated displacement are samples from the Total Lagrangian
solution (with rigid rotation factored out) and 6 rigid motion modes (generated algebraically) as input
for the Python modred package (http://pythonhosted.org/modred/), and calculated 11 Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition modes.  For the BC-MODAL approach, the 6 rigid modes are combined with deformable modes
14, 19, 26, 34, 39 (of the initial linearized system), picked by hand as visually corresponding to the
predominantly longitudinal deformation of the bar, also resulting in 11 degrees of freedom. 

Bar elongation and system energy histories, as well as convergence rates, are compared using plots.
